### What is omXplore?

`omXplore` is a [Bioconductor
package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/omXplore) that provides
functions for the visualization and the statistical analysis of proteomics data.
It can deal with common Bioconductor formats suwh as as Msnset, `QFeatures`, 
`MultiAssayExperiment`.

It is also possible to write your own plot modules so as to embed it into
the GUI of `omXplore`.

> Evolving the `DAPAR` package plots towards Shiny modules.



### Getting started

See the
[omXplore introduction](https://prostarproteomics.github.io/omXplore/articles/omXplore.html)
to get started with the visualization of data.
